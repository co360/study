The Ecosystem Project

Step 1 Exercise:

Develop a set of rules for simulating the real-world behavior of a creature, such as a nervous fly, swimming fish, hopping bunny, slithering snake, etc. Can you control the objectâ€™s motion by only manipulating the acceleration? Try to give the creature a personality through its behavior (rather than through its visual design).

- flexible ball
- two wings
- high jump, depending on the impact with the ground

Only acceleration is not enough.
