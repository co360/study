The Ecosystem Project

Step 1 Exercise:

Develop a set of rules for simulating the real-world behavior of a creature, such as a nervous fly, swimming fish, hopping bunny, slithering snake, etc. Can you control the object’s motion by only manipulating the acceleration? Try to give the creature a personality through its behavior (rather than through its visual design).

- flexible ball
- two wings
- high jump, depending on the impact with the ground

Only acceleration is not enough.


Step 2 Exercise:

Incorporate the concept of forces into your ecosystem. Try introducing other elements into the environment (food, a predator) for the creature to interact with. Does the creature experience attraction or repulsion to things in its world? Can you think more abstractly and design forces based on the creature’s desires or goals?

- environment: energy, fields and mini-enemies
- the creature experiences kinds of forces like gravity, tension... when in the action of jumping and flying... as well as the powers of enemies

- use the force when jump in two stages: normal and high, comform an enegy
- use force when in the jump action, in the stages: normal and high, according to a rate of energy


Step 3 Exercise:

Take one of your creatures and incorporate oscillation into its motion. You can use the Oscillator class from Example 3.7 as a model. The Oscillator object, however, oscillates around a single point (the middle of the window). Try oscillating around a moving point. In other words, design a creature that moves around the screen according to location, velocity, and acceleration. But that creature isn’t just a static shape, it’s an oscillating body. Consider tying the speed of oscillation to the speed of motion. Think of a butterfly’s flapping wings or the legs of an insect. Can you make it appear that the creature’s internal mechanics (oscillation) drive its locomotion? For a sample, check out the “AttractionArrayWithOscillation” example with the code download.
