;; PROBLEM:
;;
;; Use the How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe to design a function that consumes an image,
;; and appears to put a box around it. Note that you can do this by creating an "outline"
;; rectangle that is bigger than the image, and then using overlay to put it on top of the image.
;; For example:
;;
;; (boxify (ellipse 60 30 "solid" "red")) should produce [Boxify Image]
;;
;; Remember, when we say DESIGN, we mean follow the recipe.
;;
;; Leave behind commented out versions of the stub and template.

;; Image -> Image
;; Produces a image with outline effect of 2 pixel larger.
