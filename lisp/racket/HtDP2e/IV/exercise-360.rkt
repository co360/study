;; Data definitions:

(define-struct add [left right])
; An Add is a structure:
;   (make-add BSL-fun-expr BSL-fun-expr)
; interpretation (make-add l r) specifies an addition expression
;  l: is the left operand; and
;  r: is the right operand

(define-struct mul [left right])
; A Mul is a structure:
;   (make-mul BSL-fun-expr BSL-fun-expr)
; interpretation (make-mul l r) specifies a multiplication expression
;  l: is the left operand; and
;  r: is the right operand

(define-struct fun-app [name expr])
; A Fun-App is a structure:
;   (make-fun-app Symbol BSL-fun-expr)
; interpretation (make-fun-app n e) specifies an function application
;  n: is the name of the function; and
;  e: is the an expression of the function

(define-struct fun-def [name parameter body])
; A Fun-Def is a structure:
;   (make-fun-def Symbol Symbol BSL-fun-expr)
; interpretation (make-fun-def n p b) specifies an function definition
;  n: is the name of the function
;  p: is the parameter of the function; and
;  b: is the body expression of the function

; A BSL-fun-expr is one of:
;  - Number
;  - Symbol
;  - (make-add BSL-fun-expr BSL-fun-expr)
;  - (make-mul BSL-fun-expr BSL-fun-expr)
;  - (make-fun-app Symbol BSL-fun-expr)
; interpretation class of values, variables and function application to which a representation of a BSL expression can evaluate

; An Association is a list of two items:
;   (cons Symbol (cons Number '()))

; A BSL-da is one of:
; - Association
; - Fun-Def
; interpretation data definition for the representation of DrRacketâ€™s definition area
; A BSL-da-all is a [List-of BSL-da]:
; interpretation a sequence that freely mixes constant definitions and one-argument function definitions
