; Design a fire-fighting game.
;
; The game is set in the western states where fires rage through vast forests.
; It simulates an airborne fire-fighting effort.
; Specifically, the player acts as the pilot of an airplane that drops loads
; of water on fires on the ground. The player controls the planeâ€™s horizontal
; movements and the release of water loads.
;
; Your game software starts fires at random places on the ground.
; You may wish to limit the number of fires, making them a function of how many
; fires are currently burning or other factors. The purpose of the game is to
; extinguish all fires in a limited amount of time. Hint Use an iterative design
; approach as illustrated in this chapter to create this game.
