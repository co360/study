;Design a fire-fighting game.
;
;The game is set in the western states where fires rage through vast forests.
;It simulates an airborne fire-fighting effort.
;Specifically, the player acts as the pilot of an airplane that drops loads
;of water on fires on the ground. The player controls the planeâ€™s horizontal
;movements and the release of water loads.
;
;Your game software starts fires at random places on the ground.
;You may wish to limit the number of fires, making them a function of how many
;fires are currently burning or other factors. The purpose of the game is to
;extinguish all fires in a limited amount of time. Hint Use an iterative design
;approach as illustrated in this chapter to create this game.
